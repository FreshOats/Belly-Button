## Overview
The company Improbably Beef is trying to perfect the 'beef' flavor in their product composed of non-meat products. They have identified a potential source of flavoring to be connected with human belly-button bacteria, something that has been investigated by the Belly-Button Biodiversity project in North Carolina for about 10 years now. Data were collected from a number of volunteers around the country from different diversities and cultural backgrounds. When investigating the bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), the test subjects' demographics as well as belly-button type and washing frequency was collected. This project provides a visual representation of the OTUs present in each of the subjects - the top ten OTUs, the number of scrubs per week, and the bacterial cultures present in the sample.

## Results
Using javascript with HTML and CSS, an interactive website was constructed for users to be able to look at the different distributions of demographic data, top ten bacterial cultures, the washing frequency, and the overall bacterial cultures found in each subject. The bacterial OTUs were originally presented by OTU ID number, but when hovering over the graphics, the names of the bacteria in each OTU is represented if known.
